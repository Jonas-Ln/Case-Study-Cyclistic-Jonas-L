#### **Load files and packages:**
```{r Load file and packages}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(geosphere)

data_all <- list.files(path = "/Users/jonaslenz/Case Study Cyclistic/Data Sets Used", pattern = "May2021_to_April2022_Cyclist_Data.csv", full.names = TRUE) %>% 
  lapply(read_csv) %>%                        
  bind_rows
data_all_before_mapulation <- data_all
```
## **1. Data Cleaning with R**


```{r order data_all}
#order Data before cleaning by started at
data_all <- data_all[order(data_all$started_at),]
glimpse(data_all)
```
+ Deleting NA entries:

```{r create data_all}
data_all <- drop_na(data_all)
glimpse(data_all)
```

Dropped
Rows: **1,082,137** = 5,723,532 - 4,641,395

```{r count the number of casual members}
# count casuals and members before and after cleaning
count(data_all, vars = member_casual)
count(data_all_before_mapulation, vars = member_casual)
```
Compared casuals are nearly riding as much as Members in Total. The NA in the data seem random judging from the relative equality in reduction of members and casuals from the Data Frame. Therefore this can be assumed as Random noise and excluded.

<br>

## **2. Analysis with R**

### **2.1 Bike Types**

```{r count the number of casual members for each type of bike}
#count casuals and members for each different bike type

count(filter(data_all, rideable_type=="classic_bike" ), vars = member_casual)
count(filter(data_all, rideable_type=="electric_bike" ), vars = member_casual)
count(filter(data_all, rideable_type=="docked_bike" ), vars = member_casual)
```

+ 38% of the classic_bikes are used by casual members 
+ 44.55% of the electric_bikes are used by casual members
+ The docked_bikes are only used by casual members 

<br>

### **2.2 Users per Location ID** 
#### **2.2.1 Highest Count of riders per type:**

```{r List the station_ids where the number of any type of rider is the biggest}
# get the highest counts of each membership type and order them from highest to lowest

count_station_id_member <- count(group_by(data_all,start_station_id), vars=member_casual)
count_station_id_member <- count_station_id_member[order(count_station_id_member$n, decreasing = TRUE), ]
head(count_station_id_member)
```

<br>

#### **2.2.2 Highest Count of riders in Total:**

```{r Highest frequencies of used stations}
#get the highest count of total riders and order them from highest to lowest
count_start_station_id <- count(group_by(data_all,start_station_id), vars=start_station_id)
count_start_station_id <- count_start_station_id[order(count_start_station_id$n, decreasing = TRUE), ]
head(count_start_station_id)
```

<br>

#### **2.2.3 Exlude low Casual Stations**

**Next steps:**

+ Merge the 2 Tables and get the total number in order to evaluate the % of casual members per starting station. We do this because we want to know which stations are most successful for acquiring members so we can dive deeper into what reasons are behind that.

+ By knowing which stations have the highest rate of casual riders we get to know where our approach to acquire members is most successful of course in relation to the number of total members. That is why all stations below the 75 percentile casual riders are dropped in order to focus on the most important ones.

```{r Quantile and Mean of Casual_riders}
#Quantile and Mean of Casual_riders for cutting datapoints
total_station_casual <- merge(count_start_station_id, count_station_id_member, by.x = 1, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE)
total_station_casual <- total_station_casual[-c(2)] %>%
  rename(riders_total = n.x,
         member_casual = vars.y,
         total_casual = n.y)%>%
  mutate(perc_member_casual=(total_casual/riders_total*100))%>%
  arrange(. , -perc_member_casual)%>%
  subset(.,member_casual == "casual")
  mean(total_station_casual$total_casual)
  quantile(total_station_casual$total_casual)
```
```{r Highest Frequency of Casual_riders ordered by highest percentage} 
#Highest Frequency of Casual_riders ordered by highest percentage
total_station_casual <-subset(total_station_casual, total_casual >= 3150.75)
head(total_station_casual)%>%
  select(., start_station_id, riders_total, total_casual, perc_member_casual)
```

+ The dataset now contains **212 Stations**, which are most important for Cyclistic to Act on, in Descending order by the highest proportion of casual riders.

**Check if not too much Data is excluded :**

**The Dataframe contains:** 
```{r Sum all casual members after cleaning out 75% of stations}
#Sum all casual members after cleaning out 75% of stations
sum(total_station_casual$total_casual)
```
**1,645,291** out of **2,044,339** casuals from **212** biggest stations of casual riders.

<br>

#### **2.2.4 Exlude low Member Stations**

+ To get to know Differences between Members and Casuals we reverse the Task and do the same from above to Members

**Result:**

```{r Reversed to find Quantile/Mean Members }
#Reversed to find Quantile/Mean Members
total_station_member <- merge(count_start_station_id, count_station_id_member, by.x = 1, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE)
total_station_member <- total_station_member[-c(2)] %>%
  rename(riders_total = n.x,
         member_casual = vars.y,
         total_member = n.y)%>%
  mutate(perc_member_casual=(total_member/riders_total*100))%>%
  arrange(. , -perc_member_casual)%>%
  subset(.,member_casual == "member")
mean(total_station_member$total_member)
quantile(total_station_member$total_member)

```
```{r Highest frequency of members ordered by highest percentage}  
#Highest frequency of members ordered by highest percentage
total_station_member <-subset(total_station_member, total_member >= 5211)
head(total_station_member)%>%
  select(., start_station_id, riders_total, total_member, perc_member_casual)
```

+ The dataset now contains **209 Stations**, which are most important for Cyclistic to get information on members.

<br>

### **2.3 Time**

#### **2.3.1 Mean Riding-Time per rider**

```{r Mean Time Casual}
#Mean Time Casual
time_data_all <- data_all%>%
  mutate(riding_time = round(as.vector(ended_at - started_at)/60)) %>%
  arrange( . ,-riding_time)

#Select View
head(arrange(time_data_all, riding_time)) %>%
  select(., start_station_id, member_casual, riding_time)

#Select View
head(time_data_all) %>%
  select(., start_station_id, member_casual, riding_time)

mean(time_data_all$riding_time)
ggplot(time_data_all, aes(x = riding_time)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)

```

+ On average riders using the Cyclist product are cycling **ca. 21 minutes**.

+ The Highest and Lowest Values seem to be non significant **outliers** and we cut them as they do not represent our data. The Min Values especially below zero do not make any sense, but also 1 second riding_time  for example is not anything we can expand upon.

+ There are a lot of outliers as confirmed by the Boxplot above.

<br>

#### **2.3.2 Cut 1% of the bottom and Top**

```{r get Quantiles to cut data}
#get Quantiles to cut data
quantile(time_data_all$riding_time, c(.99))
quantile(time_data_all$riding_time, c(.01))
mean(time_data_all$riding_time)
```
```{r remove of Data}
#remove of Data
time_all <- subset(time_data_all, riding_time >= 1 & riding_time <= 129)
head(time_all)
mean(time_all$riding_time)
ggplot(time_all, aes(x = riding_time)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot Riding_time")
```

```{r Hist riding Time}
#Histogramm riding Time
ggplot(time_all, aes(x = riding_time)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Histogramm riding_time")

```

+ By removing outliers the average dropped by **ca. 4 Minutes**.
+ Above **40 Minutes** there are still many outliers.

+ Histogramm: the most data points are distributed on the left side, but the mean increases due to many small data points at the right side.

<br>

#### **2.3.3 Mean time Casual riders**

+ Now we aggregate the data by only displaying casuals first and then members.

```{r Casual Time box}
#Casual Time boxplot
time_all_casuals <- subset(time_all, member_casual == "casual")


mean(time_all_casuals$riding_time)
ggplot(time_all_casuals, aes(x = riding_time)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot Riding_time per Casual")
```

```{r Casual Time Hist}
#Casual Time Histogramm
ggplot(time_all_casuals, aes(x = riding_time)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  ggtitle("Histogramm Riding_time per Casual")
```

+ Casual riders have a really high riding_time. But the most important part is the riding time **1 to 50** minutes contains most of the casual riders.
+ The mean riding time of casual riders is **ca. 23 Minutes**

```{r Member Time Box}
#Member Time Boxplot
time_all_member <- subset(time_all, member_casual == "member")

mean(time_all_member$riding_time)
ggplot(time_all_member, aes(x = riding_time)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot Riding_time per member")
```

```{r Member Time Hist}
#Member Time Histogramm
ggplot(time_all_member, aes(x = riding_time)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  ggtitle("Histogramm Riding_time per member")

```

+ The mean riding time of members is **ca. 13 Minutes**
+ The mean riding_time is higher for Casuals than members by more than **10 minutes**.
+ The distribution of riding_time is much more Narrow for members. **Confirmed by the Standard Deviation:**

```{r Standard deviation riding_time}
#Standard deviation for casuals riding_time and members riding_time
sd(time_all_casuals$riding_time) 
sd(time_all_member$riding_time)
  
```

+ Cyclistic should evaluate what makes riders who ride for a mid to long time not use the membership.

<br>

#### **2.3.4 Regression: Casuals impact on riding time**

+ Trend of how the % of Casual riders impacts the average riding_time per station

+ We take the 212 Stations which have the most casual riders in Percent from **Chapter 2.2.3** :

```{r creating Df and Linear Model for Trend analysis}
#creating Df and Linear Model for Trend analysis
most_casual_riders <- total_station_casual$start_station_id[1:212]
most_casual_perc <- total_station_casual$perc_member_casual[1:212]

mean_casual_station <- data.frame(nrows = 212)

mean_casual_station <- cbind(mean_casual_station,start_station_id = c(most_casual_riders))
mean_casual_station <- cbind(mean_casual_station,perc_casual = c(most_casual_perc))

mean_list <- c()

for (i in most_casual_riders){
mean_list <- append(mean_list, mean(subset(time_all, start_station_id == i)$riding_time)) 
}

mean_casual_station <- cbind(mean_casual_station, mean_riding_time = c(mean_list))
cor(mean_casual_station$mean_riding_time, mean_casual_station$perc_casual)
head(mean_casual_station)
summary(lm(perc_casual~mean_riding_time,data=mean_casual_station))

```

+ A Linear Model like above shows the Positive significant influence of  the percentage of casuals on to the mean riding time. It also describes R^2 = **66.4%** of the Riding_Time variable.

+ **Visualization:**

```{r Plotting percentage of casuals vs. riding time}
#Plotting percentage of casuals vs. riding time
trend_casual_time <-ggplot(mean_casual_station, aes(x = perc_casual, y = mean_riding_time)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth( , se=FALSE)

trend_casual_time <- trend_casual_time + expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)

trend_casual_time<- trend_casual_time + scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))

trend_casual_time

```

<br>

### **2.4 Distance**
#### **2.4.1 Distance and Time**

+ We can not examine a distance if the end station does equal the starting station so we rule these points out.

+ Our assumption for this chapter has to be that the traveled distance to the end point is a straight line which is not realistic (on average the result should still show a certain trend).

First we examine the time it takes for a casual to ride a certain distance in comparison to a member. **(Dataframe from chapter 2.3.2)**

```{r create Distance Df and attach to location df}
#create Distance Df and attach to location df
time_distance <- time_all %>%
  subset(., start_station_id != end_station_id) 
  
time_distance$distance_m <- round(distHaversine(time_distance[,10:11], time_distance[,12:13]))

time_distance$distance_per_minute <- (time_distance$distance_m / time_distance$riding_time)

head(time_distance$distance_per_minute)
head(time_distance$distance_m)
subset_casual <-subset(time_distance, member_casual == "casual") 
  
mean(subset_casual$distance_m)

subset_member <- subset(time_distance, member_casual == "member") 
  
mean(subset_member$distance_m)

mean(subset_casual$distance_m)/mean(subset_member$distance_m)*100
```

+ Casuals ride **9%** more on an average ride.

<br>

#### **2.4.2 Distance/Time Casuals vs. Members**

```{r correlate distance and Casual status Box}
#correlate distance and Casual status Box
time_distance_casual <- subset(time_distance, member_casual == "casual")

casual <- mean(time_distance_casual$distance_per_minute)
ggplot(time_distance_casual, aes(distance_per_minute)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Casuals")

```
```{r correlate distance and Casual status Hist}
#correlate distance and Casual status Hist
ggplot(time_distance_casual, aes(x = distance_per_minute)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  ggtitle("Casuals")

```
```{r correlate distance and Member status box}
#correlate distance and Member status box
time_distance_member <- subset(time_distance, member_casual == "member")


member <- mean(time_distance_member$distance_per_minute)


ggplot(time_distance_member, aes(x = distance_per_minute)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Members")

```
```{r correlate distance and Member status Hist}
#correlate distance and Member status Hist
ggplot(time_distance_member, aes(x = distance_per_minute)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  ggtitle("Members")


(member / casual) * 100
```

+ Members ride 31.42% faster per minute on average. 
+ Are they sportier ?

<br>

#### **2.4.2.1 Are Members Sportier than Casual Riders**

+ Before we take a quick Conclusion we want to find out what influenced the location has on the traveled distance since we assumed a very simplistic model here. Using the DF from the chapter **Time**.

+ We compare the averages of the 212 stations we explored before for each member and casuals to avoid bias from non relevant locations (ruling out differences in traffic and routes).

```{r  correlation}
#creating empty vectors

mean_list_distance_casual <- c()
mean_list_distance_member <- c()
mean_list_distance <- c()

# loop to build the means under each circumstance for distance/minute
for (i in most_casual_riders){
mean_list_distance_casual <- append(mean_list_distance_casual, mean(subset(time_distance_casual, start_station_id == i)$distance_per_minute))

mean_list_distance_member <- append(mean_list_distance_member, mean(subset(time_distance_member, start_station_id == i)$distance_per_minute))

mean_list_distance <- append(mean_list_distance, mean(subset(time_distance, start_station_id == i)$distance_per_minute))
}

mean(mean_list_distance_member / mean_list_distance_casual)*100

#bind average distance per minute as column to the Dataframe
mean_casual_station <- cbind(mean_casual_station, mean_distance_minute = c(mean_list_distance))

#linear model 1: How perc_casual is explained by mean_distance_minute + mean_riding_time
summary(lm(perc_casual~mean_distance_minute + mean_riding_time, data=mean_casual_station))

#linear model 2: How mean_distance_minute is explained by mean_riding_time
summary(lm(mean_distance_minute ~ mean_riding_time, data=mean_casual_station))
```


+ The Mean for each station suggests that the members ride on average **32.45%** faster than casual riders, which suggests that the starting station has no significant influence on the Speed. 

+ The Linear model suggests that the distance_minute is not significant when we add it to the linear model from chapter 3 which is why the linear model does not explain more with adding the variable of **mean_distance_time** (R^2 = 66.11%). Also suggested by the p value 0.652 > 0.05.

+ **Result:** Members are not significantly sportier than casual riders in a linear model

+ **Next step:** Examine the exact relationship between mean distance and riding time to confirm the Result.

<br>

#### **2.4.2.2 Correlation: distance/minute Vs. %casuals/station**

```{r Distance_m vs. casuals per station}
# trend Distance_m vs. casuals per station
trend_casual_distance <- ggplot(mean_casual_station, aes(x = mean_riding_time, y =mean_distance_minute )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(, se=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Regression mean_riding_time | mean_distance")
trend_casual_distance <- trend_casual_distance + expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)

trend_casual_distance <- trend_casual_distance + scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))

trend_casual_distance

```
```{r trend_distance 2 }
#second trend graph for comparison
trend_casual_distance <-ggplot(mean_casual_station, aes(x = perc_casual, y = mean_distance_minute)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(, se=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Regression perc_casual | mean_distance")
trend_casual_distance <- trend_casual_distance + expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)

trend_casual_distance <- trend_casual_distance + scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))

trend_casual_distance

```


+ As a linear Model does not represent our Data fully we need to take a look at the Trend in the Graphs above.

+ The Scattering of the mean_distance in comparison to the mean_riding_time seems very similar.

+ The Trend line suggests a somewhat linear relationship between the two but at the edges the linearity is switching over to a logarithmic relationship.

+ In the end it is not Clear if the members are sportier the Data can not support the Claim since the distance/time does not have a significant influence on the membership. 

<br>

### **2.5 Further exploration with Tableau**

[View in Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonas112520/viz/CaseStudyCyclisticDashboard/DasboardCyclisticCaseStudy)


#### **2.5.1 Location**

+ From Chapter 1.2 we found out what Stations are most important to look at but we can not see if there are geographical differences just by looking at the raw Data.

+ Data: counts of members and casuals in all locations

```{r Export CSV for Tableau}
#Create Dataframe for Export CSV into Tableau
total_station_location <- count(group_by(data_all,start_station_id), member_casual=member_casual)

location_lat_lng <- aggregate(start_lat ~ start_station_id, data=data_all, FUN=mean)

location_lat_lng$start_lng <- aggregate(start_lng ~ start_station_id, data=data_all, FUN=mean)$start_lng

location<- merge(total_station_location, location_lat_lng, by.x = 1, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE)

location_casual <- total_station_location %>%
  subset(. , member_casual == "casual")

location_member <- total_station_location %>%
  subset(. , member_casual == "member")

difference_riders <-merge(location_casual, location_member, by.x = 1, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(difference_casual_member = n.x - n.y)

location <- merge(location, select(difference_riders, start_station_id, difference_casual_member), by.x = 1, by.y = 1, all.x = TRUE)
```

+ Plot the dataset in Tableau and get the Following Graphics as results:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/jonaslenz/Case Study Cyclistic/Case-Study--Cyclistic-Jonas-Lenz/Detailed-Report_files/figure-html/Distribution Casuals+members-2.png')
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/jonaslenz/Case Study Cyclistic/Case-Study--Cyclistic-Jonas-Lenz/Detailed-Report_files/figure-html/Distribution Casual+members 2.png')
```

+ Most casual riders use the service near the coastline of Chicago
+ Most members use the service in the city

<br>

#### **2.5.2 Compare Seasonal Time differences**

+ In addition to Chapter 2.3 (Time) seasonal Data is explored in this chapter


##### **2.5.2.1 Examine the monthly frequency of bike usage among casuals vs. members:**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/jonaslenz/Case Study Cyclistic/Case-Study--Cyclistic-Jonas-Lenz/Detailed-Report_files/figure-html/Frequency Member and Casuals Bike Usage per Month.png')
```


+ Members use the service a lot more than casuals in the winter months

+ During june to august casuals use the service a lot more frequent


<br>

##### **2.5.2.2 Examine the usage per day throughout the week:**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/jonaslenz/Case Study Cyclistic/Case-Study--Cyclistic-Jonas-Lenz/Detailed-Report_files/figure-html/Usage of Bikes per Weekday-2.png')
```


+ Members use the bike more frequent during monday-friday
+ Members still are pretty even on bike usage throughout the week

+ Casuals use the bike service a lot more frequent during the weekend

<br>


##### **2.5.2.3 Examine the Usage per hour throughout the Day:**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/jonaslenz/Case Study Cyclistic/Case-Study--Cyclistic-Jonas-Lenz/Detailed-Report_files/figure-html/Usage of Bikes per Daytime.png')
```


+ Casuals usage throughout the day is steadily increasing from 5 am to 5 pm. The usage peaks at around 5 pm and is then again steadily decreasing til 5am.


+ Members usage throughout the day is rapidly increasing from 4 am to around 7 am. From 7 am the usage decreases again til 10 am. From there on the increase is steady until 2pm, where the increase becomes rapid again and peaks at 5 pm. From 5 pm the decrease is rapid until 4 am.

<br>


## **3. Summary**

1. 38% of the classic_bikes, 44.55% of the electric_bikes and 100% of the docked bikes are used by casual members. (Chapter 2.1)

2. There are 212 Stations which are most relevant to draw Conclusions on casuals and 209 for members. (Chapter 2.2)

3. Casuals ride longer than members on average. (Chapter 2.3)

4. With longer riding time the distance/minute steadily decreases, therefore casuals ride a lot less distance/minute than members. (Chapter 2.4)

5. Members are not significantly sportier than casuals. (Chapter 2.4)

6. Casuals are a lot more likely to ride along the Coastline while members ride in the city. (Chapter 2.5.1 Location)

7. Members ride a lot more during the winter months, while casuals like to ride more during june to august. (Chapter 2.5.2.1 Usage per Month)

8. Casuals ride more on Weekends than members. (Chapter 2.5.2.2 Usage per Weekday)

9. Casuals ride the most during afternoons, while Members ride preferably during rush hours in the morning and afternoon. (Chapter 2.5.2.3 Usage per Daytime)
